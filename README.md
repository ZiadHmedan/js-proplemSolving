# JavaScript Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various JavaScript problems. Each problem is described below with a brief summary and a link to the code solution.

## Problem 1: Merge Sorted Arrays

**Description:**

Merge the arrays nums1 and nums2 into a single sorted array.
The length of nums1 is m + n, where the first m elements in nums1 represent the initial array to be merged,
and the last n elements should be ignored.

## Problem 2: Remove Element

**Description:**

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums that are not equal to val.

**Solution:**

## Problem 3: Remove duplicates

**Description:**

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.

**Solution:**

## Problem 4: Remove duplicates II

**Description:**

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice.

**Solution:**

## Problem 7: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

**Description:**

you are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

**Solution:**
[code](https://github.com/ZiadHmedan/js-proplemSolving/blob/master/maxProfit.js)

## Problem 8: Length of Last Word

**Description:**

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

**Solution:**

## Problem 9: Jump Game

**Description:**

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.
